## Learnings

- Unlimited = Steep learning curve
- Flexible = Long learning curve
- Technical = (Flexible x Unlimited)<sup>3</sup>

<Notes>
  The good(pro), the bad(wildcard) and the miserable(novice with too much power)
</Notes>

---

## Learnings

- Technical product **_could be_** easy for **_technical people_**
- Offering **_everything all the time_** is a root cause for:
  - Confusion
  - Frustration
  - Mistakes

---

## Learnings

<span>It's extremely hard, or rather, impossible,</span>
<span>to implement one solution to meet everyone‚Äôs needs</span>

---

## Learnings

<span>Listen to your customers</span>
<b>But</b>
<span>Observe their behaviour (if possible)</span>
<span>Or at least ask many many questions</span>


---

## Limit the unlimited

### Is it possible?

---

## What did we do?

- Role-based Permissions System
- Intensive use of hiding "advanced" features
- "Shortcut" Features
- "Simply" not offering everything everywhere
- (removing "white noise")

---

## What are we working on now?

- Research & analyze where we can reduce "mental overhead"
  - Eliminate "noisy" options
  - Give more power to the users
  - So they gain more confidence
- Workflow - oriented processes
- User-oriented UI re-structure

---

## Maybe some Data after all?

<span>We have lots of data</span>
<span><pre style={{display: 'inline-block'}}>4.059.029</pre> Integration Updates alone</span>
<span>in the last week from one of our biggest customers</span>

<Notes>
  50% of all...
</Notes>

---

## Last Week's requests

import RequestsImage from "./static/images/requests.png"

<Image
  src={RequestsImage}
  alt="requests last week table"
  size="30vw"
/>

---

## The Objective

<span>We could identify our customers' users behaviour</span>
<span>We could identify our customers' suggested promotions</span>
<span>We could identify what works best, when and for who</span>

---

## The Objective

<span>We could potentially help them understand,</span>
<span>what could <b>benefit their users' satisfaction</b></span>
<span>from the promotions they offer (<b>or not</b>)</span>
<span><b>when</b> to offer them</span>
<span><b>how</b> to segmentalize it</span>
<span>and more...?</span>
